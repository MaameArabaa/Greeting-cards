# React + Vite

**OVERVIEW**
The Greeting Cards application is a React project created to practice component-based architecture and prop usage. Utilizing Vite for efficient setup and Tailwind CSS for styling, this app showcases a modular UI design.
The project consists of three main components:
1. **Header**: Displays the primary heading, "Welcome to Greeting Cards."
2. **GreetingCard**: A reusable component that accepts `title` and `message` props to display customized cards.
3. **App**: The central component that defines the card data and renders multiple GreetingCard instances with unique props.

This project emphasizes dynamic rendering using props, a clean UI design with Tailwind CSS, and efficient setup with Vite. Example outputs include greeting cards like "Happy Birthday!", "Congratulations!", and "Thank You!", each dynamically styled and presented.
